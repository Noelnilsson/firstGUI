# Build

1. **Create a build directory & configure the build:**
   ```bash
   cmake -S. -Bbuild
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cmake --build build -j
   ```

This will create a `build` directory and compile all necessary artifacts there. The main executable will be located in `build/`.
